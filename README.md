# Auto Stairs Lights

## Description

The aim is to switch on led lamps when a person goes up/down the stairs and to switch them off afterwards. The lighting could be done in several ways such as a fade or sequential lighting in the direction of movement.

Here you can see a small (very brief) diagram representing the situation

The use of an arduino is recommended.

Any suggestions or modifications are welcome.
